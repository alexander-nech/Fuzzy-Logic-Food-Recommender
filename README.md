# Fuzzy-Logic-Food-Recommender

This is an alternative approach to typical recommendation systems which uses fuzzy logic to determine food preferences. Utilizing the **Mamdani Inference System**, the algorithm can take abstract and non-decrepit features, such as food tastes and preferences in order to infer concrete metrics based on that. In other words, mapping out human emotions and connections to quantifiable outputs that accurately represent those abstract preferences.

It has a simple UI, but it is meant to demonstrate the internal logic of this recommender system.
